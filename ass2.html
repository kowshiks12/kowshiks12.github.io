        <p>
          The chicken is a domesticated species that arose from the red
          junglefowl, originally from India. They have also partially hybridized
          with other wild species of junglefowl. Rooster and cock are terms for
          adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male
          that has been castrated is a capon.

        <p>
          What is a short paragraph about sushi? Sushi is made with specially
          prepared rice, called sumesh. The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt,
          and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it, but
          it sometimes has non-fish foods such as vegetables. Some sushi is
          wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called nori.
